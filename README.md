# SC230 Theta 3DOF Sim Rig
The SC230 Theta is a 3DOF sim rig made from 80/20 T-slot aluminum extrusions and
other components.

## Assemblies
The SC230 Theta is made up of several chassis that come together to create
the whole rig. The rig may be expanded by starting with the inner-most
cockpit and adding additional chassis to add motion later on.

* Cockpit Chassis
* Pitch/Yaw Chassis
* Roll Chassis
* Cradle Chassis
  * Note: The Cradle Chassis is required to suspend the Roll Chassis

## TODOs
The primary activity right now is to finalize the Cockpit Chassis as a 1.0
release of the project by itself.

* Convert the single Word assembly instructions document into individual
  assembly instructions for each chassis
* Verify the 80/20 part numbers and machine codes to produce the BOMs for each
  chassis
* Convert the SKP to STEP for use with FreeCAD and break into files for each
  chassis
